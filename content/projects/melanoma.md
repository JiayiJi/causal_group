I am conducting research with [Gen Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ligen) at the [Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), Yvonne Saenger and Robyn Gartrell from [Columbia University Medical Center](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/).

My work involved:

1. Creating interactive heat maps and adopting clustering analysis to explore hierarchical structure of melanoma gene expression data.
2. Building predictive model on recurrence using logistic regression with lasso penalty, and validated it on two separate cohorts using cross-validation with bootstrapping.
3.  Communicating results of analyses, modeling, and tests through data visualization, interactive apps, and writing in R Markdown.

Paper in progress.
