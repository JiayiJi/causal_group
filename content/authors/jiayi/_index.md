Jiayi Ji, MS. Jiayi joined the [Department of Population Health Science & Policy at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/institute-health-care-delivery/tci-biostatistics) as a biostatistician in 2018. He obtained his MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) in May 2018. Prior to switching careers into statistics, he earned his M.D in preventive medicine at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in China. His research focuses on statistical computing, Bayesian data analysis and causal inference, with application in cancer research. He has been working with Dr. Liangyuan Hu on her PCORI project, developing causal inference methods for multiple treatments and a binary outcome.
